  <h1>Stacks – Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> November 12, 2025</p>

  <p>
    Stacks (“the Game”, “we”, “our”, “us”) is an online multiplayer strategy game developed and published by the Stacks Team.
    This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you play the Game or interact with its online services.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    We do not collect personally identifiable information directly from you.
    However, certain information may be collected automatically or via third-party services we use to provide online gameplay, analytics, and advertising.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Device information:</strong> model, operating system, language, and country.</li>
    <li><strong>Gameplay data:</strong> game sessions, match results, in-game actions, and preferences.</li>
    <li><strong>Identifiers:</strong> automatically generated user IDs, Google Play Services ID, or similar.</li>
    <li><strong>Log data:</strong> connection events, latency, or errors used to improve stability.</li>
    <li><strong>Analytics data:</strong> anonymized data on engagement and performance.</li>
    <li><strong>Ad data:</strong> non-personalized or personalized ad impressions, depending on your device settings.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    The Game integrates the following third-party services, each governed by its own privacy policy:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>PlayFab (by Microsoft)</strong> – for online matchmaking, account management, and cloud storage.<br>
      <a href="https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement" target="_blank">https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement</a>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Microsoft Azure (by Microsoft)</strong> – for hosting and content delivery (e.g., textures, sound files, and other game assets).<br>
      <a href="https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement" target="_blank">https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement</a>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Google Sign-In (by Google LLC)</strong> – for optional login and authentication.<br>
      <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Google Play Services / Firebase Analytics (by Google LLC)</strong> – for analytics, crash reports, and performance monitoring.<br>
      <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>
    </li>
    <li><strong>AdMob (by Google LLC)</strong> – for displaying in-game advertisements.<br>
      <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Enable gameplay, matchmaking, and save synchronization;</li>
    <li>Improve stability, performance, and user experience;</li>
    <li>Analyze anonymized metrics to improve game design;</li>
    <li>Display ads or promotional content (if applicable);</li>
    <li>Ensure compliance with platform and security requirements.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    We retain anonymized gameplay and telemetry data only as long as necessary for game operation, analytics, and legal compliance.
    Personal data managed by third-party providers (e.g., PlayFab, Google, Microsoft Azure) is subject to their own retention policies.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Stacks is not directed toward children under 13 years old (or under 16 in some regions).
    We do not knowingly collect or store personal data from minors.
    If you believe a minor has provided us with personal information, please contact us to request deletion.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    We use Microsoft Azure’s secure global infrastructure to deliver game assets efficiently.
    Azure automatically processes limited technical data (such as IP address and request metadata) for service delivery, caching, and performance optimization.
    This data is not used for user profiling or advertising.
  </p>
  <p>
    We also implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information against unauthorized access, alteration, or loss.
    However, no online service can guarantee absolute security.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>
    Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict use of your data collected by third parties.
    You can exercise these rights by contacting the relevant provider (Google, Microsoft PlayFab, Microsoft Azure) or adjusting your device’s privacy settings.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
    The latest version will always be available through the link provided on our Google Play page.
    Your continued use of the Game after any changes means you accept the updated Policy.
  </p>
